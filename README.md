#### What is Acrylic?
Acrylic is asynchronous, mapping data to tasks, and using a type system to create modules that interface with the same concepts.

Acrylic can be used for apps, systems, and modeling concepts.

Itâ€™s designed to be transparent and translatable by allowing micro-instructions to exist in the same domain as macro-instructrions.
